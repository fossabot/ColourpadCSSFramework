ColourpadCSSFramework
=====================

Build websites in minutes using grids with automatic mobile compatibility

I know, I know. There's a lot of 'CSS frameworks' around, most are responsive too. So why did you make another one? Because I wanted to scratch my own itch.

A lot of other CSS frameworks didn't do it for me, so I created Colourpad. Colorupad is a responsive CSS framework that will provide:

A grid layout structure
Automatic responsive features, such as 'mobile mode'
A built in reset
Advanced CSS3 logic to help determine best way to show an object.
All of this is available in a few little KB's of CSS. I built this to scratch my itch, and maybe it'll scratch yours too.

**Currently there's no documentation or cheat sheet available, but I am working on these! The download is mainly available for internal projects or for people I know. I'm looking to expand this soonish.
